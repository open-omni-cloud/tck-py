# Open Omni Cloud Manifesto

## Vision
The cloud should be truly open, **verifiable**, and resilient.
We believe that organizations deserve freedom from disguised **vendor lock-in**, marketing buzzwords, and lowest-common-denominator abstractions.
Our mission is to build an ecosystem where cloud systems can be verified, tested, and trusted across providers.

---

## Principles
- **Contracts Over Abstractions**: **Verifiable Contracts** and **Testability** define the standard, not lowest-common-denominator abstractions.
- **Composition by Design**: Standards must be extensible, favoring architectural composition (like **Policy Mixins**) and adhering strictly to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.
- **Provider Neutrality**: Every provider can join, no exclusivity, no lock-in.
- **Transparency**: Open governance, open source, open discussions.
- **Resilience & Portability**: Systems must run reliably across clouds without rewrites.

---

## Commitments
- The TCK (Technology Compatibility Kit) will always remain open and free.
- The **Certification Contract** (test definitions) will be published, versioned, and governed publicly.
- We will provide reference implementations to guide providers and users.
- Community contributions and provider certifications will be recognized and celebrated.
- Commercial extensions will never compromise the openness of the core.

## Call to Action
We invite engineers, providers, and organizations to join us in shaping a truly Omni-Cloud future.
Contribute code, ideas, and feedback.
Help us build a stronger, open community where the cloud is no longer just a marketing term — but a verifiable, testable reality.

**Open Omni Cloud is more than a project: it’s a movement towards freedom, trust, and collaboration in the cloud.**
