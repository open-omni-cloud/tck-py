# Security Policy

The Open Omni-Cloud team and community take the security of the `tck-py` project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported Versions

As this is a new project, only the latest versions are actively being monitored for security vulnerabilities. Please ensure you are using the most recent release.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `0.1.x` | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are committed to working with the community to resolve security issues.

```admonition danger
**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**
```

Instead, please report them privately using one of the following methods:

1.  **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting**: This is the preferred method. You can submit a report directly and securely through the "Security" tab of our GitHub repository.
    -   [**Report a vulnerability here**](https://github.com/open-omni-cloud/tck-py/security/advisories/new)

2.  **Email**: If you prefer, you can send an email to the project maintainers at:
    -   `security@openomnicloud.org`

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, you should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. We will then coordinate with you to:
-   Confirm the vulnerability.
-   Determine the scope and impact.
-   Develop a patch.
-   Release a new, patched version of the TCK.
-   Publicly credit you for your discovery (if you wish).

We kindly ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a patched version has been released.
